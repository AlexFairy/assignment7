# 1. Product Review Analysis 
# 
# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

#Write a program that searches through reviews list and 
# looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", 
# "bad", "poor", and "average". 
# We want you to capitalize those keywords then 
# print out each review. 
# Print out each review with the keywords in 
# uppercase so they stand out.

# "This product is really GOOD.

# Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  
# The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.
